## Overview

The Racoon Detection project focuses on using object detection techniques to identify and locate raccoons in images. This project utilizes machine learning and computer vision to build a model capable of detecting raccoons with a high level of accuracy.

### Web App comming soon!

## Dataset
Dataset include 200 images files belonging to 2 classes(Racoon or not).

## Getting Started
The goal of this project is to create a reliable and accurate raccoon detection system using state-of-the-art object detection techniques. The system will be able to process input images and identify the presence of raccoons by drawing bounding boxes around them.
